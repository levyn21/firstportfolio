            <p>Speculum Cerebri is an interactive installation that explores the relationship between human perception and machine vision. The piece uses a combination of computer vision, projection mapping, and real-time data processing to create a dynamic environment that responds to the presence and movements of viewers. As participants move through the space, they trigger changes in the projected visuals, which are generated based on their interactions. The installation aims to challenge traditional notions of seeing and being seen, inviting viewers to consider how technology mediates our experience of reality.</p>

            <p>This project reimagines the photographic process using ultrasonic sensing rather than light. An ultrasonic sensor mounted on a Raspberry Pi captures continuous distance measurements, which are streamed into a Processing program that builds interactive 3D point, line, and shape visualizations. Users can navigate and capture these simulated “images” in real time.</p>
            <p>Photographic principles are translated into sound-based equivalents: aperture corresponds to the signal’s beam width, shutter speed to the frequency of emitted pulses, and ISO to the sensitivity of echo detection. By reframing light-based controls into ultrasonic parameters, the work explores how image-making can shift from optical to spatial perception, creating a new way to “photograph” the environment through sound.</p>
